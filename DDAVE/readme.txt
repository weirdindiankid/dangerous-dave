NOTE: Don't blame, I hate writing readme files :-P

This was the version 0.80, I found somewhere time before
and I adapted it to modern systems. It was for 16-bit systems
and only for DOS, so I threw that shit out. 
Now it is 32-bit or 64-bit depending for what system you 
downloaded. It unpacks any exe file that is packed 
with any lzexe algorithm, yeah even the newer ones.

It was a C Code that also had a lot of issues and which crashed
a lot. Nevertheless I'm pretty sure it was the most recent 
programm. All those problems are fixed here.

And don't be surprised. It's integrated in CG, another
great project we have and where you got that tool, of course!

You don't know what CG is? Blame yourself!! ;-)

How to use it?
--------------

unlzexe file.exe

It will generate file.exenew, which is the unpacked programm.
Check it out! Rename it, scope it, do whatever you wish :-)

Have fun with it!!!

NOTE: The author won't take responsabilites for any 
damage or outlaw that could have been committed with that program. 
If you want to blame someone for what happens and is 
not right, blame someone else and observe results. :-P
