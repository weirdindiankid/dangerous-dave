## Dangerous Dave

As a child, I spent several hours playing and losing to this game and vowed to beat it some day.
I never could beat it, but now that I have the power to program things, I rewrote the game (with quite a bit of help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnjRWRyHTLZo5l7cfq04Uwg" target="_blank">MaiZure's Stuff</a> to make Dave immortal and beat the game in < 10 minutes. 7 year old Dharmesh is celebrating so hard.

### Instructions
If you have a MacBook Pro, you can just run the <code>lmdave</code> executable. Otherwise, run <code>make</code> and execute <code>lmdave</code>
You will need SDL2 and gcc to compile this.
